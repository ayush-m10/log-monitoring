Log Monitoring and Analysis Script This Python script is designed to monitor a log file in real-time, analyze the log entries, and generate reports based on the log contents. It provides the following features: 1. *Real-time Log Monitoring: The script continuously monitors a specified log file and captures new log entries as they are appended to the file. 2. **Log Analysis: It analyzes each log entry for specific keywords such as ERROR, WARNING, and INFO. When a keyword is found, it logs the occurrence and saves the analysis result. 3. **Summary Report Generation*: Additionally, the script can generate a summary report based on the log file contents. It identifies the most common error messages and outputs them along with their occurrence count. ## Requirements - Python 3.x - Libraries: time, signal, logging, re, collections ## Usage 1. *Clone the Repository*: ```bash git clone <repository_url> log_monitor.py: The main Python script containing the monitoring, analysis, and report generation functionalities. monitor.log: Log file where monitoring events and errors are logged. analysis_results.txt: File where analysis results (found keywords) are saved. summary_report.txt: Generated summary report containing top error messages and their occurrences. NOTE: The script provides a basic framework for log monitoring and analysis. Additional features and enhancements can be implemented based on specific use cases and requirements.
